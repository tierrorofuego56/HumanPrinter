# HumanPrinter
The Human Printer is a program that, depending on the inputs the user provides, will create a human that makes a vivid image in your head and can even help you when it comes to visualizing anything with humans, such as drawing, sculpting, etc. Some inputs are very strict and require that the person tends only to the inputs valued.
